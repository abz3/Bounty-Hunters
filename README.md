# Bounty-Hunters

Really simple game where you have to set up a trap by predicting where an AI controlled pirate ship will be in x ammount of nights.

You may adjust your prediction (to a certain degree) every night; however, your final score is calculated based on accuracy and the number of adjustments made. So lowering the distance between the target and the pirate will increase your score, but making excess adjustments will lower your score.

Factors controlling the AI pirate ship:
  - Obstacles/Repellents: Islands, typhoons, navy ships (Navy ships move each night)
  - Incentivizes/Attractors: Treasure, ports
  - Wind direction & speed
  - Leadership (certain pirates captains are good at manueavering their ship, some are not)
